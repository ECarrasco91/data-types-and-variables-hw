## Homework

#### Requirements

- Fork this repo: _click the Fork button in GitHub_
- Clone your fork to your computer
  - _navigate to the directory where you want git create the copy of your fork_
  - _use `git clone <url>` to do the cloning_
- Open the IntelliJ project found in the `starter-code` folder
  - _select the `starter-code` folder to open, not one if its subfolders_
  - _in general, you want to select the folder that contains the `.iml` file and the `src` directory as the one to open - in this case, `starter-code` meets those criteria_
- Complete the code in `Main.java` based on the instructions in the comments

#### Starter code

The starter code is in `starter-code/src/ly/generalassemb/Main.java`. Curious about the "ly/generalassemb" part? [Read here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/namingpkgs.html) about package names in Java.

#### Deliverable

Once you complete the code in `Main.java`, do the following:

- Commit your changes
  - _do `git add <relative path to file you changed>` to stage the file you updated, or just `git add .` to stage everything in your current working directory_
  - _run `git commit -m "put your commit message here"` to commit the staged file(s)_
  - _if you forget the `-m` and the Vim editor opens, you can hit `:q` then enter to close it_
- Push your local commits to your fork on GitHub
  - _do `git push origin master`_
  - _go to your fork on github, refresh the page, and you should see your new commit(s)_
- Submit a pull request on GitHub from your fork back to the original repo
  - _please put your name in the pull request title_
  - _from the original repo, click on the "Pull Requests" tab and double check that your request appears in the list_
